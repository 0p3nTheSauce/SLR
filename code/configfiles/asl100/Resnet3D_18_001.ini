; based on Resnet3D_18_000 and S3D_002
; found that increasing the batch size worked well
; however did not increase batch size to 16, as that would push GPU memory too far

; significant improvement over the previous Resnet3D_18_000 in terms of speed
; could stand to use more memory, either in the form of large frames or more frames
