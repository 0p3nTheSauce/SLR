- hframe_hwd (S3D 13) best val loss: 1.85474 ; best val acc: 68.3432 
    Original 

@conclusion: don't increase backbone_init_lr (+ ~0.37 val loss) worse
- hframe_hwd1 (S3D 14) best val loss: 2.22761 ; best val acc: 62.42604
    increased the backbone_init_lr (of hframe_hwd)
    by x10 (1e-5 -> 1e-4) and suffered a noticeable knock in
    performance

@conclusion: experiment more with lr scheduler (+ ~0.007 val loss) worse
- hframe_hwd1_nosched (S3D 15) best val loss: 2.23484 ; best val acc: 61.2426
    was the same as hframe_hwd1, but with
    no lr scheduler, and sufered a slight knock in performance

@conclusion: maybe increase the backbone_weight_decay (- ~0.04 val loss) better
- hframe_mwd (S3D 16) best val loss: 2.18403 ; best val acc: 60.65089
    was the same as hframe_hwd1, but decreased the
    backbone_weight_decay by x10 (1e-3 -> 1e-4), and saw a small 
    decrease in val loss, but worse val acc
    
    (but small effect)

@conclusion: inconclusive, vary eps by less (+ ~0.04 val loss) worse
- hframe_hwd_leps (S3D 17) best val loss: 1.89451 ; best val acc: 65.68047
    was the same as hframe_hwd, but decreased 
    the adam eps by x10000000 (1e-3 -> 1e-8), and saw a slight 
    kncock in performance 

@conclusion: still worse performance, vary eps by less (+ ~0.08 val loss) worse 
- hframe_hwd_leps2 (S3D 18) best val loss: 1.93781 ; best val acc: 68.3432
    was the same as hframe_hwd, but decreased 
    the adam eps by x1000000 (1e-3 -> 1e-7), 

@conclusion: still worse in loss, but now better in acc (+ ~0.1 val loss) worse
- hframe_hwd_leps3 (S3D 19) best val loss: 1.95846 ; best val acc: 69.52663
    same pattern as previous eps experiments. eps now at (1e-6)

    now an improvement on the previous highest (S3D 13) in acc but worse in loss

@conclusion: an improvement on hframe_hwd (eps 1e-5) (- ~0.13 val loss) better
- hframe_hwd_leps4 (S3D 20) best val loss: 1.72448 ; best val acc: 73.66864
    eps: 1e-5

    an improvement

@conclusion: another small improvement (1e-4) (- ~1.9 val loss) better
- hframe_hwd_leps5 (S3D 21) best val loss: 1.66771 ; best val acc: 73.37278
    eps: 1e-4

    slight improvement in loss, but acc declines

@conclusion: improvement stops, dont increase eps more (+ ~0.08) worse
- hframe_hwd_leps6 (S3D 25) best val loss: 1.9324 ; best val acc: 68.9349
    eps: 1e-3

    decrease in loss and accuracy

@conclusion: nvm i take it back, keep eps here or 1e-4 (- ~0.3) better
- hframe_hwd_leps7 (S3D 26) best val loss: 1.5451 ; best val acc: 70.4142
    eps: 1e-2

    another improvement in loss

@conclusion: experiment with wram up, (- ~0.08 val loss) better
- hframe_hwd_warmups (S3D 22) best val loss: 1.64363 ; best val acc: 71.89349
    Same as hframe_hwd_leps4, but with warm ups

    slight improvement in loss, but acc declines

@conclusion: experiment with warm restarts (- ~0.28 val loss) better
- hframe_hwd_warmrestarts (S3D 23) best val loss: 1.44793 ; best val acc: 71.30178
    Same as hframe_hwd_leps4, but with warm restarts and eta min = 0

    slitght improvement in loss, while acc declines

@conclusion:  experiment with warm restarts, but lower eta min to 0 (- 0.099 val loss) better 
- hframe_hwd_warmrestarts2 (S3D 27) best val loss: 1.6258 ; best val acc: 71.0059 
    Same as hframe_hwd_leps4, but with warm restarts

    slight decrease in loss compared to (S3D 23) hframe_hwd_warmrestarts, but 
    better than hframe_hwd_leps4 (worse accuracy though)

@conclusion: experiment with dropout, but dont go this low (+ 2.94 val loss) much worse
- hf_hwd_eps_dp01 (S3D 24) best val loss: 4.66636 ; best val acc: 21.59763
    Same as hframe_hwd_leps4, but with dropout = 0.1

    huge knock in performance

@conclusion: add more dropout (+ ~0.24 val loss) worse
- hf_hwd_eps_dp02 (S3D 29) best val loss: 1.9626 ; best val acc: 67.4556 
    Same as hframe_hwd_leps4 but with dropout = 0.2

@conclusion: add more dropout (+ ~2.9 vl) worse
- hf_hwd_eps_dp03 (S3D 30) bvl: 2.0132 bva: 68.6391
    Same as hframe_hwd_leps4 but with dropout = 0.3

@conclusion: maybe add more dropout (- ~0.03 vl) better
- hf_hwd_eps_dp04 (S3D 31) bvl: 1.6876 bva: 73.3728
    Same as hframe_hwd_leps4 but with dropout = 0.4

@conclusion: not much diff (+ ~0.0054 vl) worse
- hf_hwd_eps_dp06 (S3D 32) bvl: 1.7299 bva: 73.0769
    Same as hframe_hwd_leps4 but with dropout = 0.6

@conclusion: a bit better than 0.4 (- ~0.056 vl) better
- hf_hwd_eps_dp07 (S3D 33) bvl: 1.6676 bva: 74.8521 
    Same as hframe_hwd_leps4 but with dropout = 0.7

-- drop_p = 0.4 -> 0.7 seems fine


@Conclusion: both warm ups and warm restarts reduced loss, and even more when combined (- 0.17 val loss) better
- hf_hwd_eps_wups_restarts (S3D 28) best val loss: 1.5499 ; best val acc: 69.8225 
    Same as hframe_hwd_leps4, but with warm ups and warm restarts

    improvement on hframe_hwd_leps4 in loss, but not acc. 
    improvement on hframe_hwd_warmrestarts2 in loss, but not acc
    improvement on hframe_hwd_warmups on loss, but not acc

    next up: try lower eta min as per hframe_hwd_warmrestarts

@conclusion: can use batch size of 8 (+ ~ 0.03) 
- hf_hwd_eps_hbs (S3D 34) bvl: 1.7605 bva:  70.7101
    Same as hframe_hwd_leps4, but with increased batch size (same equivalent) 
    and drop_p = 0.1

 -- can use batch size of 8 with 32 frames and 224 width, decreases runtime


@conclusion: not much diff, but slightly better with eta_min = 0 (- 0.0026 val loss) better
- wups_restarts_et0 (S3D 35) best acc, best loss: 69.2308  1.5235
    Same as hf_hwd_eps_wups_restarts but with eta min = 0

@conclusion: dont set eps to e-2, but also not much diff (+ 0.0073) worse
- wups_restarts_eps2 (S3D 36) 69.8225       1.6228
    Same as hf_hwd_eps_wups_restarts but with eps = 1e-2


@conclusion i guees set eps to -4, but -5 probs fine (-0.06 ) better
- wups_restarts_eps4 (S3D 37) 70.7101       1.4899
    Same as hf_hwd_eps_wups_restarts but with eps = 1e-4

#Misc
i notice the time of runs increases with the better runs taking longer

-added type in scheduler as an after effect
