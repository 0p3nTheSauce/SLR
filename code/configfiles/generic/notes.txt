- hframe_hwd (S3D 13) got the highest score so far

- hframe_hwd1 (S3D 14) increased the backbone_init_lr (of hframe_hwd)
    by x10 (1e-5 -> 1e-4) and suffered a noticeable knock in
    performance (1.98 -> 2.3 val loss)
    
    conclusion: don't increase backbone_init_lr

- hframe_hwd1_nosched (S3D 15) was the same as hframe_hwd1, but with
    no lr scheduler, and sufered a noticeable knock in performance
    (2.3 -> 2.8 val loss)

    conclusion: include lr scheduler

- hframe_mwd (S3D 16) was the same as hframe_hwd1, but decreased the
    backbone_weight_decay by x10 (1e-3 -> 1e-4), and saw a small 
    increase in val loss, but also val accuracy 

    conclusion: don't increase the backbone_weight_decay 
    (but small effect)

- hframe_hwd_leps (S3D 17) was the same as hframe_hwd, but decreased 
    the adam eps by x10000000 (1e-3 -> 1e-8), and saw a noticeable 
    kncock in performance (1.98 -> 2.22)

    conclusion: inconclusive, vary eps by less






#Misc
-added type in scheduler as an after effect
