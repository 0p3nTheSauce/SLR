- hframe_hwd (S3D 13) Original
    best val loss: 1.85474 
    best val acc: 68.3432

- hframe_hwd1 (S3D 14) increased the backbone_init_lr (of hframe_hwd)
    by x10 (1e-5 -> 1e-4) and suffered a noticeable knock in
    performance
    best val loss: 2.22761
    best val acc: 62.42604
    
    conclusion: don't increase backbone_init_lr

- hframe_hwd1_nosched (S3D 15) was the same as hframe_hwd1, but with
    no lr scheduler, and sufered a minor loss in performance
    (2.3 -> 2.8 val loss)
    best val loss: 2.23484
    best val acc: 61.2426

    conclusion: experiment more with lr scheduler but at least not hurting

- hframe_mwd (S3D 16) was the same as hframe_hwd1, but decreased the
    backbone_weight_decay by x10 (1e-3 -> 1e-4), and saw a small 
    increase in val loss 
    best val loss: 2.18403
    best val acc: 60.65089

    conclusion: don't increase the backbone_weight_decay 
    (but small effect)

- hframe_hwd_leps (S3D 17) was the same as hframe_hwd, but decreased 
    the adam eps by x10000000 (1e-3 -> 1e-8), and saw a slight 
    kncock in performance 
    best val loss: 1.89451
    best val acc: 65.68047

    conclusion: inconclusive, vary eps by less
    

- hframe_hwd_leps2 (S3D 18) was the same as hframe_hwd, but decreased 
    the adam eps by x1000000 (1e-3 -> 1e-7), still worse performance, but an improvement
    best val loss: 1.93781
    best val acc: 68.3432


- hframe_hwd_leps3 (S3D 19) same pattern as previous eps experiments. eps now at (1e-6)
    best val loss: 1.95846
    best val acc: 69.52663

    now an improvement on the previous highest (S3D 13)

- hframe_hwd_leps4 (S3D 20) 
    best val loss: 1.72448
    best val acc: 73.66864

    another improvement

- hframe_hwd_leps5 (S3D 21)
    best val loss: 1.66771
    best val acc: 73.37278

    improvement stops



#Misc
i notice the time of runs increases with the better runs taking longer

-added type in scheduler as an after effect
