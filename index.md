## Welcome to WLASL Homepage
WLASL is a large-scale video dataset for Word-Level American Sign Language (ASL) recognition, which features 2,000 common different words in ASL. We hope WLASL will facilitate the research in sign language understanding and eventually benefit the communication between deaf and hearing communities.
