Misc TODOs:
- Repo-wide: audit blind `except Exception` blocks (training.py, que/worker.py, etc.) and
  replace with handling for specific exception types instead of blanket-catch + str(e).
  Concrete motivating case documented in src/que/todo (Worker section): a bare, message-less
  Exception from wandb's own hyperband/early-terminate thread-kill mechanism currently gets
  either silently swallowed or reported indistinguishably from a real crash, depending on
  which layer it surfaces at.
